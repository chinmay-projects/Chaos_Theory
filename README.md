# Chaos_Theory
Chaos theory is a branch of mathematics and physics that deals with complex systems whose behavior is highly sensitive to initial conditions. It essential describes how relativily simple systems can exhibit extremely complex and unpredectible motion.

## Lorentz Attractor (Butterfly Effect)
The Lorenz attractor is a set of chaotic solutions to a system of three non-linear differential equations. It was first studied by Edward Lorenz in 1963 as a simplified model of atmospheric convection, but it has since become a classic example of chaotic systems in mathematics and physics.

The Lorenz system of equations is given by:

$$dx/dt = \sigma*(y-x)$$

$$dy/dt = x*( \rho -z)-y$$

$$dz/dt = x*y - \beta*z$$

where x, y and z are the variables of the system, and $\sigma$, $\rho$, and $\beta$ are parameters. The system exhibits chaotic behavior for certain values of these parameters. In the code you provided, the parameters are set to $\sigma$ = 10.0 , $\rho$ = 28.0 , $\beta$ = 8.0 / 3.0 which are the commonly used values to visualize the Lorenz attractor.
